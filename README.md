# CrossMarkets Expert Advisor

This Expert Advisor, called CrossMarkets, is designed to trade on multiple currency pairs simultaneously. It is a sample code provided by Forex Robot Easy Team and can be used as a reference for implementing similar trading strategies.

## Initialization

The `OnInit` function is called during the initialization of the Expert Advisor. Any necessary initialization code should be added here. In this sample code, no specific initialization is performed.

## Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit` function is called when the Expert Advisor is being stopped or removed from the chart. Any necessary cleanup or deinitialization code should be added here. In this sample code, no specific deinitialization is performed.

## Trading Logic

The `OnTick` function is called on every tick of the chart. This is where the trading logic is implemented. In this sample code, the `Trade.CrossMarkets()` function is called to execute the trading strategy.

## CrossMarkets Class

The CrossMarkets class is the main class that contains the trading logic for the Expert Advisor. It has the following member functions:

- `CrossMarkets()`: The constructor of the class. It initializes the `CTrade` object and sets the expert magic number for tracking trades.

- `CrossMarkets()`: The main trading logic function. It iterates through a list of currency pairs and checks if a trade should be opened for each pair. If the conditions are met, it calls the `OpenTrade()` function.

- `ShouldOpenTrade(string currencyPair)`: This function is used to determine whether a trade should be opened for the given currency pair. In this sample code, a placeholder logic is used, which always returns true.

- `OpenTrade(string currencyPair)`: This function is used to open a trade for the given currency pair. In this sample code, it calls the `Buy()` function of the `CTrade` object to open a buy trade with a volume of 0.1 for the specified currency pair.
